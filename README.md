# Cisco Packet Tracer Lab - Network Security and Routing Simulation

## Description
This lab is a network simulation created in **Cisco Packet Tracer**, demonstrating a multi-branch enterprise network with security and attack scenarios. The topology includes:

### Devices Used:
- **Cisco 2911 Routers** (R1, R2)
- **Cisco 2960 Switches** (SW1, SW2)
- **Cisco 5505 Firewalls** (FW1, F2)
- **PCs** (PC1, PC2)
- **Servers** (SV1, SV2)
- **Attacker Laptop**

### Network Structure:
- **New York Branch**: Includes PCs, a switch, and a router.
- **Tokyo Branch**: Includes servers, a switch, and a firewall.
- **The Internet**: A connection between branches and an attacker attempting network breaches.
- **Firewalls**: Used to secure inter-branch communication.

## Objectives
- Learn **network security concepts**.
- Practice **routing and firewall configurations**.
- Simulate **cyberattack scenarios and defenses**.

## Setup Instructions
1. Open the **.pkt** file in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Configure IP addresses, routing tables, and firewall rules as needed.
3. Test connectivity between branches.
4. Simulate an attack from the "Attacker" laptop and observe firewall behavior.

## Notes
- The devices are connected using **Packet Tracer's "Automatically Choose Connection Type" function**.
- Modify firewall rules to **enhance security** and prevent unauthorized access.
